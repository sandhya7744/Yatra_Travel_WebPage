                <p>Travelling is one of the most challenging and more fun experiences people could have. A person can explore other places and at the same time help himself to have a new perspective in life. Travelling provides positive effects and benefits to an individual's life. One of the reasons why people are traveling is because he wants to challenge themselves and wants to discover how they will manage everything when he will meet new people when and finding new experiences in new places and other things. Many people travel for different purposes. Whether it is for a family trip with family or a  trip with a group of friends, we see people travelling often. Some people prefer a hilly areas for travelling while the others like travelling to places with temples , monuments etc. It mainly  teaches us how to make new friends. The world is full of people who love interacting. We get to make friends when we travel to new places and spend quality time with new people. Moreover, it also helps us to enhance our social skills. After that, travelling is great for learning new skills. For instance, going to mountain regions teaches us how to trek. Similarly, going to beaches helps us to learn scuba diving or surfing.</p>
