                <div class="text p2">
                    <p>* An iconic landmark of Kolkata, Howrah Bridge is a massive steel bridge constructed over the Hooghly River. It is considered to be among the longest cantilever bridges in the world. Also known as Rabindra Setu, it connects Howrah and Kolkata. It carries daily traffic of over 100,000 vehicles and countless pedestrians and is as historic as it is grand. </p>
                    <p>* The opulence of the bridge, however, comes alive in the night time as it is all lit up. You can also take a ferry ride as it runs between Kolkata and Howrah, from the launch ghat. The view of the city from the ferry, especially in the night, is priceless, to say the least.</p>
                    <p>* Howrah Bridge was the third-longest cantilever bridge at the time of its construction, but now it is the sixth-longest one of its types. It was renamed as Rabindra Setu on June 14, 1965, after the name of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. It spreads about 1500 ft over the Hooghly River and is 71 ft wide. There is a total of 8 lanes of strand road, bicycles, and pedestrians. What makes this bridge unique is the fact that it was built without a single nut or bolt and is held together by rivets.</p>

                    <p>* One of the most famous historical sites in Kolkata and once a British stronghold, is the mighty edifice of Fort William. Built in 1696, the fort was named after King William III, a.k.a William of Orange. Standing tall as a testimony to all tales of victories and defeats as well as oppression and rule, Fort William is the only fort in the world from which not a single shot was ever fired.</p>
                    <p>* The massive fort that is situated on the banks of the Hooghly River is an octagonal structure stretching over an area of 70.9 hectares of land and has six different gates. The foundation of this fort was laid by Sir Robert Clive. At present, the fort is used as military headquarters of Eastern Command and also has the capacity to accommodate up to 10,000 army personnel at one time.</p>
                    <p>* Today, the Fort William that people know is the magnificent structure that stands by the beautiful Hooghly River. However, most of us are unaware that there were two Fort Williams, the first one was built in 1696 which became famous as the "Black hole of Calcutta" and the second and newer one was built in 1757 which still stands.</p>
                    <p>* Fort William is a very well defended fort and the only fort in the entire world which has never been besieged.</p>

                    <p>* St. Paul's Cathedral is a Church of North India cathedral of Anglican background in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, noted for its Gothic architecture and dedicated to Paul the Apostle. It is the seat of the Diocese of Calcutta. The cornerstone was laid in 1839; the building was completed in 1847.</p>
                    <p>* Located across the Birla Planetarium, the Cathedral is the seat of the Diocese of Calcutta. The cornerstone was laid in 1839, while the rest of the building was completed in 1847. Said to be the largest church in Kolkata and the first Anglican cathedral in Asia, it was also the first new-built cathedral in the overseas territory of the British Empire. </p>
                    <p>* The edifice stands on Cathedral Road on the "island of attractions" to provide for more space for the growing population of the European community in Calcutta in the 1800s. The architectural design is "Indo-Gothic", which is a Gothic architectural style designed to meet the climate of India. Following the 1897 earthquake and the subsequent massive earthquake of 1934, when Calcutta suffered substantial damage, the cathedral was reconstructed to a revised design. The cathedral complex has a library, situated over the western porch, and a display of plastic art forms and some other memorabilia.
